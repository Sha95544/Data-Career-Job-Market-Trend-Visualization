# Data-Career-Job-Market-Trend-Visualization
This project visualizes a dataset from survey results of 600+ participants in PowerBI working in careers that are related or unrelated to the "data" domain. 
## Data overview
The data for the dashboard comes from an excel file showing the responses of survey participants in a tabular format. Some columns such as "Unique ID", "email etc are shown below.It can be seen that some of these columns are blank and thus serve no purpose in creating the final dashbpard.
