# Data-Career-Job-Market-Trend-Visualization
This project visualizes a dataset from survey results of 600+ participants in PowerBI working in careers that are related or unrelated to the "data" domain.

The data was transformed within the PowerQuery editor within PowerBI for cleaning purposes. 

The first step involved removing the colums labelled E to I since they are completely blank and serve no purpose for the visualization.
